# Titanic Survival Prediction

Predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques on passenger data.

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to build a model predicting passenger survival. It includes data exploration, cleaning, feature engineering, model training with Logistic Regression, and evaluation.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.10.7 
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
- jupyter notebook  
- ydata-profiling (optional)


## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Download `train.csv` from the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) and place it in the `data/` folder.  
2. Open the notebook `notebook/titanic_prediction.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.  
3. Run all cells step-by-step to reproduce the analysis and model training.


## ðŸ“Š Results

- Logistic Regression model accuracy: **81%**  
- Confusion matrix and classification report included in notebook.  


## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

- Gender and passenger class significantly influenced survival chances.  
- Data cleaning and feature engineering improved model performance.  
- Future work: try advanced models, hyperparameter tuning, or deploy as an app.
